# Configuration

## Environment variables

Mail notifications for contact form submissions use the following environment variables (typically defined in `app.env`).
PHPMailer can be loaded either via Composer (preferred) or from the bundled fallback copies stored in `lib/PHPMailer`.

### Do I need to run Composer on the server?

It depends on how you deploy:

- **If you run `composer install` as part of your deployment**, the autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php` will be present and the contact page will automatically use the Composer-installed PHPMailer package.
- **If you do not run Composer on the server**, no additional commands are required. Just make sure the `lib/PHPMailer` directory from this repository is uploaded alongside the rest of the site filesâ€”the contact page will fall back to those bundled sources.

Either option is supported; choose the workflow that best matches your hosting environment.
